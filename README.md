## Quotes Scrapper

This project automates the extraction of quotes and stores them in an SQLite database for easy retrieval and analysis. It uses Python libraries like BeautifulSoup for web scraping and SQLite3 for data storage, ensuring efficient handling of scraped information.

The script consists of two modules: scrapped.py for scraping and data.py for managing the database. Users can run the scraper to fetch quotes and store them, then query the database for retrieval. 

Data for this project was scrapped from https://quotes.toscrape.com/
